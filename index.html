  <h3>Question 4: What is DNS and when it come in picture</h3>
  <p>
    DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain
    names (like www.google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like
    142.250.183.206) required to locate and connect to servers on the
    internet. When you enter a domain name into a browser, DNS comes into play
    by resolving the name to its corresponding IP address through a series of
    queries involving local caches, DNS servers, and authoritative servers.
    This process happens instantly, enabling seamless access to websites and
    online services by bridging the gap between human-friendly names and
    computer-required addresses.
  </p>
  <h3>Question:5 What is markup</h3>
  <p>
    In HTML, markup refers to the use of tags and attributes to define the
    structure and presentation of content on a webpage. It involves embedding
    instructions (tags) within text to indicate how different parts of the
    content should be interpreted by a browser. For example:
  <p>paragraph tag</p>
  </p>
  <h3>Question:6 SEO</h3>
  <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of optimizing a website or web content to improve its visibility
    and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs) for relevant keywords or queries. The primary goal of SEO is to
    drive organic (unpaid) traffic to a website by making it more discoverable and user-friendly.</p>


  <h3>Question:7 Inspect element</h3>
  Inspect Element is a feature available in modern web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) that allows users to
  view and edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of a webpage in real time. It is a tool primarily used by developers and
  designers to debug, test, or modify the structure and styling of a website.

  <h3>Question:8 Explain what is webpage designing</h3>
  <p>Answer:- Webpage designing is the process of creating the visual layout, structure, and functionality of a webpage
    to ensure it is appealing, user-friendly, and serves its intended purpose. It combines both aesthetics and
    functionality to provide a positive user experience.</p>

  <h3>Question:9 how will you open another windows using anchor tag</h3>
  <p>
    To open another window using an anchor (<a>) tag in HTML, you can use the target="_blank" attribute. This tells the
      browser to open the linked URL in a new tab or window (depending on browser settings).
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Open google in a New Window</a>

  </p>
  <h3>Question:10 What does viewport meta tag do</h3>
  <p>The viewport meta tag is used in HTML to control how a webpage is displayed on mobile devices. It allows developers
    to set the viewport size and scale, ensuring that the content is responsive and fits properly on screens of various
    sizes.</p>

  <h3>Question:11 What are Attributes in html</h3>
  <p>In HTML, attributes are additional properties or settings applied to HTML elements that define their behavior,
    appearance, or functionality. Attributes provide extra information about an element and are written inside the
    opening tag of the element.
  <h4>Common Attributes are</h4>
  <li>id</li>
  <li>class</li>
  <li>style</li>
  <li>tittle</li>
  </p>
  <h3>Question:12 What is DNS</h3>
  <p>DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into
    machine-readable IP addresses (like 142.250.183.206). Computers use IP addresses to communicate over networks, but
    DNS simplifies this process by allowing users to use easy-to-remember domain names instead of numerical addresses.
  </p>
  <h3>Question:13 What is ip address</h3>
  <p>An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to a
    network, such as the internet. It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other over a network.</p>
  <h3>Question: 14 What is localhost</h3>
  <p>Localhost is a hostname that refers to the computer or device you are currently using. It is used to access network
    services running on the same machine, typically for development, testing, or troubleshooting purposes.

    In most systems, localhost resolves to the IP address 127.0.0.1 (for IPv4) or ::1 (for IPv6).</p>

  <h3>Question:15 HTML5 vs HTML4</h3>
  <p>HTML5 is a significant improvement over HTML4, offering native support for multimedia with audio and video
    tags, semantic elements like header and section for better structure, and new form controls such as email
    and date for enhanced usability. It eliminates the need for plugins like Flash by introducing features like
    the canvas and svg for graphics. HTML5 is mobile-friendly, includes APIs for geolocation and local
    storage, and simplifies coding with a shorter doctype declaration. Unlike HTML4, which relied heavily on
    external tools and generic elements, HTML5 is modern, efficient, and designed for responsive web
    development.</p>
  <h3>Question:16 what are semantic tags</h3>
  <p>
    Semantic tags in HTML are elements that provide meaningful structure and clearly define the purpose of the content
    they enclose, improving both the readability of the code for developers and the accessibility for search engines and
    assistive technologies. These tags describe the role of the content, making it easier to understand and process.</p>
  <h3>Question:17 Write code to create an ordered list with roman numbers</h3>

  <h3>Question:23 Create radio button (MERN, MEAN : course)and checkbox(HTML, CSS, React, Node : technology) and explain the difference between these two</h3>
  <h2>Select Your Course (Radio Buttons)</h2>
  <form>
    <label>
      <input type="radio" name="course" value="MERN"> MERN
    </label><br>
    <label>
      <input type="radio" name="course" value="MEAN"> MEAN
    </label><br>

    </label><br>
    <label>
      <input type="checkbox" name="technology" value="Node"> Node
    </label><br>
  </form>
  <p>Radio buttons allow users to select only one option from a set of choices, ensuring that only one item is selected at a time, while checkboxes enable users to choose multiple options independently, as each checkbox operates independently from the others. In radio buttons, selecting a new option automatically deselects the previous one within the same group, whereas checkboxes allow multiple selections without any automatic deselection.</p>  

<h3>Question:24 How many types of heading does an HTML contain?</h3>
HTML contains 6 levels of headings, ranging from h1 to h6. These headings are used to define the structure and hierarchy of content on a webpage:
<p>
  h1: Represents the highest level of heading, typically used for the main title of the page. <br>
  h2: Used for subheadings under the h1 heading. <br>
  h3: Represents subheadings under h2. <br>
  h4: Used for subheadings under h3. <br>
  h5: Represents subheadings under h4. <br>
  h6: The lowest level of heading, used for the least important subheadings.
</p>
<h3>Question:25 Which heading have highest priority and Least priority.</h3>
<p>H1 is the highest priority heading <br>
H6 is the least priority heading</p>
<h3>Question:26 How to create a hyperlink in HTML?</h3>
<p>To create a hyperlink in HTML, use the (anchor) tag with the href attribute, which specifies the URL or link destination. The text or content between the opening  and closing tags becomes clickable. <br>
  synatax: <code>&lt;a&gt;<a href="URL">Clickable Text</a>&lt;/a&gt;</code>

  </p>
  <h3>Question:26 Which HTML tag is used to display the data in the tabular form?</h3>
  <p>The table tag is used in HTML to display data in a tabular form. It organizes data into rows and columns, making it
    easy to present structured information like schedules, reports, or comparisons.</p>
  <h3>Question:27 Why do we use colgroup tag in table tag.</h3>
  <p></p>
  <h3>Question:26 What are some common lists that are used when designing a page?</h3>
  <p>When designing a webpage, HTML lists are commonly used to organize and display content. There are three main types
    of lists in HTML: <br>
    ol:- Order list <br>
    ul:- Unorder List <br>
    DL:- Defination List</p>
  <h3>Question: 28 Write a structure of definition list.</h3>
  <p>
    <code>
  &lt;dl&gt;&lt;
 &gt;    &lt;dt&gt; Term 1 &lt;/dt&gt; <br>
    &lt;dd&gt; Definition or description of Term 1.&lt;/dd&gt; <br>
    
    &lt;dt&gt; Term 2 &lt;/dt&gt; <br>
    &lt;dd&gt; Definition or description of Term 2.&lt;/dd&gt; <br>
    
    &lt;dt&gt; Term 3 &lt;/dt&gt; <br>
    &lt;dd&gt; Definition or description of Term 3.&lt;/dd&gt; <br>
  &lt;/dl&gt;
</code>
  </p>
  <h3>Question:29 What does mean by of dl, dt and dd in definition list.</h3>
  <p>
    <li>(Definition List) is the container tag that holds the entire list of terms and their definitions. It groups all
      <br>
      the items together.
    </li> <br>

    <li>(Definition Term) is used to define the term or item you want to explain or describe. It's the label or word
      <br>
      for which a definition is provided.
    </li><br>

    <li>(Definition Description) follows each <br>
      tag and contains the actual definition or explanation of the term. It provides the details or description <br>
      corresponding to the term. </li><br>

    In essence, the &lt;dl&gt; creates the structure for a list of terms, &lt;dt&gt; defines the term, and
    &lt;dd&gt; gives the explanation or description of each term. This structure is particularly useful for glossaries,
    FAQs, or whenever you need to list terms and their definitions.
  </p>
  <h3>Question:30 What is the difference between HTML elements and tags?</h3>

  In HTML, tags are the markup symbols (like &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;) used to define the start and end of an element,
  while an <br>
  element refers to the entire component that includes the opening tag, the content within it, and the closing tag. For
  <br>
  example, in &lt;p>&gt; This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;, &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; are the tags, and the entire &lt;p&gt;
  This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; is the <br>
  element. So, tags are the syntax used to create elements, and elements are the complete units of content defined by
  <br>
  those tags.

  <h3>Question:31 What is semantic HTML?</h3>
  <p>Semantic HTML refers to the practice of using HTML tags that convey meaning about the content they enclose, rather
    <br>
    than just structure or presentation. These tags help both browsers and developers understand the type of content
    <br>
    they represent, improving accessibility, SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and code readability. <br>
    example: &lt;header&gt; &lt;/header&gt; <br>
    &lt;form&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</p>

  <h3>Question:32 What is an image map?</h3>
  <p>
    An image map is an HTML technique that allows you to create clickable areas on an image, where different regions of <br>
    the image can link to different destinations. Instead of having one large clickable image, you can define multiple <br>
    "hotspots" or clickable areas within the image, each linking to different URLs or sections of the page.</p>
